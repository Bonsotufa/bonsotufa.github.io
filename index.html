	 <p>I’m a person highly interested on computer based education on both hardware and software part.<br>and i highly believe on myself if i try some thing new i will do it.<br>and i want to stay in this field and be a software engineer. I believe if person do what he or she like they will be more succeeded.<br>I’m interested in computer science, music, sport and fantasy literature. Computers first appeared in my life when I was 12.<br> Then I had got my first computer. It was Toshiba 64 and I remember myself thinking, that it was the best thing in the world. <br>I was playing it whenever I could. Then I had got my first PC. <br>At first, I was just playing computer games, but some time later, I noticed that I could do a lot more things with the computer, for example programming. <br>Now, I can already programed in java,C++ and HTML.  I hope that in the future I will get a job as a computer scientist.
